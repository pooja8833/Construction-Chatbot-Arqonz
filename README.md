🏗 BuildBot
      Arqonz is an AI-powered chatbot designed to answer construction-related questions quickly and accurately. Built using Flask for the backend and Ollama (Mistral:instruct) for AI responses, this tool aims to assist construction professionals, students, and enthusiasts with instant guidance, tips, and explanations.
      
✨ Features

🛠️ Technology Stack
      Backend: Flask (Python) – Handles routing, API calls, and server logic.
      Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript – Interactive and responsive UI.
      AI Model: Ollama (Mistral:instruct) – Provides contextual and accurate responses for construction queries.
      
💡 How It Works
      User types a question in the chat interface.
      Frontend sends the query to the Flask backend.
      Backend communicates with the Ollama AI model to generate a response.
      Response is sent back and displayed in the chat window with animations and avatars.
